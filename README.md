# Time-Series-Forcasting (Sequence to Sequence Learning with Encoder-Decoder Neural Network Models)


## Introduction:

This is a project completed during my study in M.S. Business Analytics program at University of Minnesota - Fall 2019 course in Predictive Analytics (supervised learning). We designed a solution for a [time series forcasting competition problem on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting) using stacked generalization with XGBoost and LSTM (Seq2Seq with Encoder-Decoder), which result in final performance of .5000 RMSLE. My colleagues Sam Musch has created a well-organized project summary in his [github link](https://github.umn.edu/MUSCH038/Predictive-Project---Time-Series), including data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training. Therefore, I would like to use this github to give a practical introduction specifically to the Sequence to Sequence Learning with Encoder-Decoder Neural Network techniques, using the data in this project as an example. 


## Main Files:


## How to reproduce competition results:
1. Download input files from https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting : key_2.csv.zip, train_2.csv.zip, put them into data directory.
